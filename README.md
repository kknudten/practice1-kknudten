When at a party, I explain my field of study (data science) as a combination of statistics and computer science. I take confusing data and make it understandable for others who have no experience.

**I tell people that my field of study is taking data, manipulating it, and using it to make informed decisions.**

In the last month, the three main activities I have been doing are working as a receptionist at Serenity Couture in Ames, meal prepping & working out, and completing homework.

**In the past month, the three main activities I do when I study are rewrite and summarize notes, watch videos on how to do certain types of problems, and complete homework.**

The three most important tools I use for organizing my work is: my online iPad planner, the Dashboard feature on Canvas, and making to-do lists.

**The three most important tools I use for organizing my work are Microsoft OneNote to keep track of deadlines, planners and notebooks to organize notes and written homework, and a file system on my computer to keep track of online homework and files.**
